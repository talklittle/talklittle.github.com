## Goodbye RIF

A short message and a going-away song for RIF.

If you haven't yet, please visit: [Goodbye RIF](./goodbye)

## How can we say goodbye to RIF?

You can create an account at [lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/) and post to the [redditwasfun](https://lemmy.world/c/redditwasfun) community.

A lot of people leaving Reddit are headed to Lemmy. We'll see you there.

## What's next for the dev?

I'm working on an app for [Tildes.net](https://tildes.net), a nonprofit, discussion-oriented community.

If you're a longtime RIF user, you may like Tildes. I'm on both Tildes and Lemmy.
