## A message

Thank you everyone for your support since 2009.

Thank you to /u/anon_smithsonian in particular for taking care of everyone on /r/redditisfun.

RIF, you're quirky and rough around the edges, but you've always gotten the job done. You know how to get out of the way and show people the articles, discussions, pictures, and videos they came for.

You have the silliest name, but we love you all the more for it. RIF will always be fun in our hearts.

RIF has been so much of my life.

I'm honored that so many of you have felt the same way.

Thank you for sharing this journey with me. It's been fun.
