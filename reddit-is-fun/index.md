## FAQ

* dual-pane tablet mode
* moderator features
* history sync via [synccit](http://synccit.com)

reddit is fun is currently closed source as of version 2.0 which was a rewrite.

[Diode](http://github.com/zagaberoo/diode) is an open source GPL fork of reddit is fun 1.3.

## Usage FAQ

### How do I register an account?

Via the [reddit website](https://ssl.reddit.com/login).

### Why am I being rate limited?

You should [verify your email](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update).

### How do I view the sidebar?

First you have to be within a subreddit, not the frontpage and not /r/all or /r/mod. Click the "i" icon in the top bar.

### <strike>Why do webpages and images reload when I rotate my device?</strike>

This is fixed in version 2.7.3, released January 25, 2013.

### Are animated GIFs supported?

They are supported, but it depends on your device. Manufacturers have the ability to disable GIF animations in Android WebViews.

If your device is affected, and you see still images instead of animated GIFs, your best bet is to open the GIF in the external Android Browser, which has custom GIF support.
